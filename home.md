## About VectorNet
VectorNet is a project of the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) which aims to contribute to improving preparedness and response for vector-borne diseases, following a ‘One-Health’ approach. The VectorNet consortium brings together a network of medical entomologists and public health professionals, together with veterinary entomologists and veterinarians working the field of vector-borne disease in Europe and the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Basin. The project also provides ad-hoc scientific advice to support ECDC and EFSA with technical questions on vector surveillance and vector-borne disease in humans and animals.

VectorNet started in May 2014, and is now running its third iteration (2024–2029). VectorNet supports the collection of data on vectors and pathogens in vectors related to both animal and human health. The project is structured in 5 work packages, fostering Collaboration, Preparedness, Agility, Communication and Project coordination and management.

Vectornet maintains a common database on the presence and distribution of vectors and pathogens in vectors across Europe and the Mediterranean basin. The project is operated by a consortium including the following VectorNet experts. The vectornet database is uploaded periodically on the GBIF Vectornet Data portal. 

The primary outputs of VectorNet have been, anc continue to be, the Vector maps: (/www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/disease-vectors/)

There are also many more reports and tools produced by the VectorNet, many of these organized on (/www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/disease-vectors/), but others published by EFSA in their journals. A list of Vector Net experts appear below:
