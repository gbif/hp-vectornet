## VectorNet
VectorNet is a project of the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) which aims to contribute to improving preparedness and response for vector-borne diseases, following a ‘One-Health’ approach.

VectorNet started in May 2014, and is now running its third iteration (2024–2029). VectorNet supports the collection of data on vectors and pathogens in vectors related to both animal and human health. The project is structured in 5 work packages, fostering Collaboration, Preparedness, Agility, Communication and Project coordination and management.

Vectornet maintains a common database on the presence and distribution of vectors and pathogens in vectors across Europe and the Mediterranean basin. The project is operated by a consortium including the following VectorNet experts. The vectornet database is uploaded periodically on the GBIF Vectornet Data portal.
